# the-matrix
a simple command-line tool to encrypt and decrypt text messages.
## Overview üìù

It takes plaintext input and transforms it into an encrypted unreadable cipher text using a custom algorithm, and vice versa.
The encrypted cipher text changes every second, making it highly dynamic and visually fascinating!

---

## Features üöÄ

- Encrypt any plain text message into a complex cipher text.
- Decrypt the cipher text back to the original message.
- The cipher text updates every second, providing a continually evolving encryption display.
- Easy-to-use interactive command line interface.
- Commands:
  - `e` to start encrypting a new message.
  - `d` to decrypt an existing cipher text.
  - `exit` to quit the program.

## Usage Example üíª

```plaintext
>> e
plain text: hello world

Encrypted text: ‡§ù‰∫åÊúà‡∏Æ‡∏ï◊¶„Åï„Å¨·Éì„Åï„Åù‡∏ÑÊúâ‡§∑„ÇØ◊ú–§Œ°„Ç™◊ó‡§ò„Éå‡∏âÂçÉ‰∏≠‡§°‰∫î„Çø·É•‡∏â„Å¨ÊòØ„ÉãŒ°◊©‡∏Ñ·É£„Ç™‡∏ùŸÑÂú®ÊúâŒëŒ°◊ñ‰πù„Ç¶‡∏©‡∏´ÊòØ‡∏âŒõ‡§¢‰∏ç„Çª‰∫åŒñ‡∏îŒû„ÅÇ„Çø‡§ô„Åì„Åì·Éö –£·Éö„Éé„ÅìËæ∞

Decrypted text: hello world 

>> exit
```

## Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

- Python 3.x (Assuming the program is written in Python based on typical CLI tools. Please clarify if different.)

---

## How to Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the program with the command:

```bash
python your_program_filename.py
```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to encrypt, decrypt, or exit.

## Notes üß†

- The encryption scheme produces Unicode cipher text with diverse characters, making it visually complex and interesting.
- Each cipher text output changes every second, adding a dynamic and fresh feel for every viewing.
- This is a fun and creative text transformer tool suitable for personal use or learning about simple encryption concepts.
- Not intended for secure encryption needs.
